I have a Thinkpad T420 on Windows 7 that I'd like to factory reset.

I can verify that my system (T420) is having graphical issues and random freezes since upgrading from 1703 to 1803 on May 1st. I had no major problems in the previous version. I use Ubuntu as my main OS and also have a Windows 7 drive for troubleshooting and in those environments, my system is running flawlessly. So I'm confident it's a Windows 10 1803 system issue.

Hi! ‚ò∫ I got sick of Windows and switched to Linux on my Lenovo ThinkPad T420 two months ago. üê¨ After trying a few distro/flavors I settled on Xubuntu 18.0.4. It was always a little buggy with random program crashes and errors, but it worked fine until last night. When I rebooted last night, it asked me to unlock my disk, log into my user acct, ‚Ä¶ then it went to a flickering white screen. I did a little research and figured the problem was "LightDM" went rogue.

"The initial condition" ( It was grubby and unloved, in fact it was ready to be dismantled for parts as it had a lot of stuff missing.

Hey there. After searching the internets for about 3 hours and finding no solution, I've decided to give it a shot here. I will gladly remove this post if it doesn't belong here. Namely, I've bought a used Thinkpad T420. I want to install a fresh Windows using a bootable USB stick. I've done this already a million times on my desktop PCs, but never run into this problem. The problem is that the laptop doesn't see the USB inside its BIOS (or in the boot menu which opens after pressing In preparation for Windows 10, I decided to update the BIOS on my ThinkPad T420s. Now strangely, the BIOS completes POST and diagnostic, but refuses to boot to any device. Literally will startup, show the screen, detect hardware, then reboot right after/during the Hard Disk Active Protection ROM (it's visible when quick boot is disabled and slow boot/diagnostic is on). What I suspect is a bad flash, but because I cannot make it to the point when I can boot a CD/USB/HD, I can't figure. 
Hi there, just received my refurbished ThinkPad T420 and I am super happy about it. I am wondering though, today I will go and buy a SSD to upgrade. What is the best way for me to put windows and everything back on to the SSD? My refurbished T420 doesn't come with a recovery CD, so I am wondering how could it be done. I don't care about data in the hard drive as I have never used it. But I would like the drivers to be working. Also, should I put in the Windows License Key first before I upgrad. I am trying to reset my ThinkPad T420s to factory default. It does not have the OEM install or recovery partition. I do not have the recovery disks. I have tried to use the Rescue and Recovery software but have failed. I was thinking that maybe somebody on here could give me the ISO for the disk or the image of the recovery partition. Anyone. Hey there friends. I bought a T420 from Amazon a few days ago. It's the first and only ThinkPad I've ever owned. It seems to be in fairly good condition but I have some concerns. I bought it along with an SSD, and I was going to do the install of that and the reinstallation of all the software myself this afternoon, however, it seems that the Data Media isn't present on the Lenovo Recovery Partition. I've done my research and If I understand it correctly Hey all, Thanks for being part of this great community. So I had an HP Pavilion for about a year or so before its motherboard burnt out (the model number isn't written on the case, but it had Windows 8.1 and was at least far enough along the line to have touchscreen monitor if that means anything). I had to get a new laptop of course, and I ended up getting a Lenovo ThinkPad T420s - absolutely love it. The laptop guy even managed to scavenge an 8gb RAM card from the dead HP laptop Evening all, I've got two questions I could do with a second opinion on, the other tech savvy friend of mine only seems to know the words "yeah sure, it'll work." Thinkpad T420 I've recently bought a Lenovo Thinkpad T420 off of Amazon. I was told that it was basically a brand new refurbished machine but booting it up I found a few programs that don't seem to be part of the standard install like OpenOffice, Google toolbars and some other pointless crap. The Lenovo apps like the power manag. 
As the title states, I bought a used Lenovo ThinkPad T420s with no OS installed on it. I have my own copy of Windows 7, but when I boot to the DVD drive with the disk, it just goes to the system recovery tool, tells me it can't auto recover and restarts. There is an option to restore the laptop to factory settings, but when I select it, it says there are no backup files on the computer. It also has an option for advanced options, but tells me I need to log in to access it with no prompt I have an old T420 Thinkpad with mint installed on it and it has been working great for me. When I was at school I think my battery died and ever since it has been frozen on the splash screen before I'm able to login (screen with the little lm logo). This guy seems to be having a similar problem, but I have no idea how to use vi and gedit doesn't seem to work from the power shell in recovery. Any advice Hi fellow Thinkpad lovers! I bought a T420 which has Win 7 preloaded. It has three drives (Windows_OS of around 450 gigs on C, System of 20 gigs on D and Lenovo Restore of 25 gigs on G) configured. I am not planning to use Windows as of now and want to wipe it off the drive. But at the same time, since I already have paid for it, don't want to lose it either, so I want to create recovery media. What should a linuxer do in this case? Shrink the C and install dual-booting linux? (I attempted. View and Download Lenovo ThinkPad T420 4236 user manual online.
